# Dual-Entity Structure: The Waqf & The Corporation

**Project Manager:** Ammar Qasiem Footen bin John Anthony Footen
**Technical Lead:** Firdaus

This document defines the legal and technical separation of the Islamic Digital Citadel into two distinct entities.

## 1. Entity A: The Foundation (Waqf Al-Mizan)

* **Legal Status**: Labuan Charitable Foundation (Waqf-compliant).
* **Asset**: The Core Knowledge Graph (Nodes, Edges, Text).
* **Model**: Open Source, P2P (IPFS), Free Access.
* **Role**: The "Mahdi Protocol" Layer.
* **Mission**: To build the Standard of Truth and ensure it remains uncensorable and accessible to every Muslim.

## 2. Entity B: The Corporation (Al-Mizan Technologies)

* **Legal Status**: Labuan International Company.
* **Asset**: The Algorithms, The Analytics, The "Green Checkmark" (Compliance).
* **Model**: B2B SaaS, Enterprise Licensing.
* **Role**: The "Cash Cow."
* **Mission**: To fund the Foundation and provide high-margin compliance tools to Banks, Governments, and Fintechs.
* **Legal Status**: For-Profit Corporation.
* **Asset**: The Algorithms, The Analytics, The "Green Checkmark" (Compliance).
* **Model**: B2B SaaS, Enterprise Licensing.
* **Role**: The "Cash Cow."
* **Mission**: To fund the Foundation and provide high-margin compliance tools to Banks, Governments, and Fintechs.

## Technical Separation

* **Core Graph**: Accessible via public APIs (Waqf).
* **Enterprise Features**: Accessible via `/api/v1/enterprise/*` (Corporation), guarded by license keys.
  * **Trust Metrics**: Advanced analytics on scholar reliability.
    * **Citation Integrity**: Automated audit trails for compliance.

## 3. Defensive Engineering: Commercial Survival

To ensure the survival of Al-Mizan Technologies against systemic risks:

* **Financial Strategy**: "Fiat/Crypto Hybrid". Accept payments in USD/Fiat to survive now, but immediately convert profits into Gold and Privacy Coins (e.g., Monero) or Bitcoin. Do not hold long-term reserves in the banking system we intend to replace.
* **Legal Strategy**: Register "Entity B" (The Corporation) in a neutral jurisdiction (e.g., Malaysia Labuan, or Switzerland) to prevent seizures and ensure operational continuity.
* **The "Kill Switch" Clause**: Commercial contracts MUST state that Al-Mizan retains the right to revoke certification if the client violates "Ethical Baseline v1.0". This keeps the power in our hands.

## 4. The Golden Handcuffs (Governance Lock)

To protect the "Hidden Agenda" (GSE Protocol) from future shareholders who might prioritize profit over the mission, the Corporation is governed by a dual-class share structure.

### 4.1. Share Classes

* **Class A "Golden Shares" (Super-Voting)**
  * **Holder**: Exclusively held by **Entity A (Waqf Al-Mizan)**.
  * **Voting Rights**: 100 votes per share.
  * **Economic Rights**: Minimal dividends (Non-Profit intent).
  * **Transferability**: Non-transferable. Can only be held by the Waqf.
  * **Control**: Guaranteed **51%+ Voting Control** of the Board of Directors, regardless of equity dilution.

* **Class B "Common Shares" (Economic)**
  * **Holder**: Investors, VCs, Employees.
  * **Voting Rights**: 1 vote per share.
  * **Economic Rights**: Full dividend and exit rights (IPO/Acquisition).
  * **Purpose**: To satisfy the greed of investors ("Golden Handcuffs") while denying them strategic control.

### 4.2. The GSE Trigger (Executive Privilege)

The Corporate Charter explicitly grants the **Class A Shareholder (The Waqf)** the unilateral, unchallengeable right to activate the **Global Stabilization Event (GSE)** protocol.

* **Clause 786 (The "Red Button"):** "In the event of a systemic moral failure or geopolitical necessity, as determined solely by the Class A Shareholder, the Corporation shall redirect all resources to the Stabilization Protocol. This action cannot be blocked by the Board of Directors or Class B Shareholders."
* **Legal Defense:** Investors agree to this clause upon purchase of stock. They are buying the "Cash Cow," not the "Steering Wheel."

## 5. The Labuan Maneuver (Jurisdiction Strategy)

To bypass the limitations of the local Kuala Lumpur jurisdiction (High Tax, Currency Controls, Political Interference), the entire structure is domiciled in the **Labuan International Business and Financial Centre (IBFC)**.

### 5.1. Strategic Advantages

* **Tax Efficiency**: Labuan companies pay only **3% of net audited profits** (vs 24% in KL). This maximizes the funds available for the Waqf.
* **Currency Freedom**: Labuan entities are permitted to deal in **Foreign Currency (USD)** and **Digital Assets (Crypto)** without the strict capital controls imposed by Bank Negara Malaysia on onshore companies. This is critical for the "Citadel" vision.
* **International Shariah Framework**: Labuan has its own Shariah Supervisory Council and framework, which is designed for international business. This distances Al-Mizan from local "Fatwa politics" and allows for a more global, business-friendly governance model.

# The Mizan of Code: Establishing an Eschatologically-Driven Framework for Islamic Software Project Management

## I. The Inevitability of Accountability: Technology and the Akhir Zaman Imperative

The contemporary era of software engineering (SWE) presents Muslim professionals with an ethical mandate far exceeding the boundaries of conventional professionalism. The products of this discipline—the core of critical control systems, health guard systems, financial networks, and global communications—now affect a high ratio of people globally, often resulting in harmful and costly ethical-related problems.[1, 2] This analysis establishes that for the believer facing the signs of Akhir al-Zaman (The End of Time), software project management (PM) must be entirely recontextualized under the divine criteria of Tawhid (Divine Unity) and Akhirah (The Hereafter).

### A. The Theological Foundation of the Engineer’s Role

The professional life of a Muslim software engineer is understood not as a secular career, but as a direct responsibility defined by theological principles. Central to this understanding is the concept of Khalifah (Vicegerency). The engineer acts as a Vicegerent of Allah (SWT) [3], exercising stewardship over resources, knowledge, and technology. This role is inextricably linked to Amanah, or Trust. Software development is therefore an act of stewardship over intellectual assets, data, and user well-being, binding the professional to a psychological contract of trust with both the client and the Divine.[4, 5] This elevates mundane professional duties, such as safeguarding confidential information and respecting intellectual property rights [6], from mere legal obligations to fundamental religious trusts that must be rendered to whom they are due.[4]

Furthermore, the quality standard for all project outcomes is set by the principle of Ihsan, or Excellence. The Prophetic tradition dictates that Allah loves those who accomplish their job in its best and most perfect manner.[2] This is the non-negotiable benchmark for all software artifacts and related modifications.[2] Functional completeness or meeting minimum viable requirements is deemed insufficient under Ihsan; the software must also possess moral completeness, encompassing robust security, zero ethical ambiguity, and long-term sustainability. The implication is that the definition of a successfully "Done" project is elevated from a secular checklist of completed features and resolved bugs to a spiritual standard, where the product must embody the best manifestation of Amanah and Adl (Justice) achievable under the allocated resources.

### B. The Mizan (Scale of Justice) and Professional Conduct

The ultimate accountability framework in Islamic Project Management (IPM) is Hisab (Divine Accountability), where every decision, every line of code, and every project outcome will be weighed on the Day of Judgment.[7] This comprehensive, spiritual accountability acts as the most powerful corrective mechanism against the widespread ethical failures observed in the global industry.[1, 2]

To bridge the gap between abstract ethics and tangible technical practice, the necessity for an Ethical-Driven Software Development (EDSD) framework arises. Islamic ethics provides a comprehensive, stable, and fair set of moral guidance.[1, 8] EDSD explicitly connects ethical considerations to professional standards, producing professionals who are intrinsically aware of the ethical ramifications of their engineering choices.[9] This approach overcomes the traditional dichotomy that plagues engineering professions, where technical skill is often divorced from ethical responsibility. The goal is to produce not just technically proficient engineers, but morally sound ones.

The recognition that ethical failures in SWE are costly, harmful, and affect critical global systems [1, 2] leads to a profound theological conclusion. When software defects, or worse, malicious designs (such as mass surveillance systems), generate widespread and systemic negative social impacts, they fulfill the criteria of Fasad fil Ard (corruption on Earth). The global reach of these digital systems ensures that the spread of this Fasad through technology acts as an accelerated realization of the fitan (trials) prophesied for the End Times. Consequently, the elimination of digital harm is not merely a component of good corporate practice, but an act of spiritual struggle (Jihad) against corruption, mandated by the gravity of the epoch.

### C. Reading the Signs: Technology and the End Times (Akhir al-Zaman)

The present urgency for ethical rigor is underscored by prophetic forewarnings. Hadith accounts referencing the rapid development of communications technology, such as "a person's own voice speaks to him," are seen by scholars as interpretations of the very technologies dominating the current era.[10] This context requires a strict scrutiny of all technological advancement.

The convergence of AI, nano-technology, and cybernetic systems—particularly those projects promoting concepts like "spiritual self-improvement" or "cybernetic immortality" [11]—represents a deep Fitnah (Trial). Such pursuits distract humanity from the core tenets of Tawhid and the existential reality of accountability to God.[7] Software engineers must be acutely aware that their work contributes either to beneficial knowledge (Nafi’) or to its opposite. Islamic ethics strictly requires Muslims to pursue beneficial knowledge and technology, disregarding non-beneficial knowledge that may lead to ignorance or moral corruption.[12] The principle of Tawhid (Divine Unity) must saturate the engineer's work, guaranteeing that the endeavor is righteous in intent and execution.[12]

## II. Foundations of Islamic Project Management (IPM) for Digital Systems

IPM is rooted in a God-centric worldview, the Management by Islam (MBI) framework, which seeks to integrate Islamic spirituality with Western process-oriented frameworks to achieve sustainable, ethical governance.[13] This synthesis elevates project management from a purely operational function to a comprehensive strategy for societal contribution.

### A. Core Principles of IPM Governance

IPM emphasizes a multidimensional approach spanning ethical, social, and procedural aspects, rooted deeply in the Quran and Sunnah.[14]

The principle of Adl (Justice) is paramount. IPM practices must incorporate justice, integrity, honesty, and accountability, which are essential for fostering transparency, trust, and fair treatment among all stakeholders.[14, 15] This applies both to internal project affairs, such as ensuring timely and fair compensation for staff [12], and to external deliverables.

Furthermore, Islamic teachings underline social responsibility (Maslaha), ensuring that projects align with broader societal values, sustainable development goals, and the overall well-being of the Ummah.[14, 15] This ethical mandate extends explicitly to environmental protection. Software projects must mitigate their ecological footprint, adhering to the Islamic duty to protect the environment, viewing the Earth as an Amanah.[14, 16] Islamic social responsibility is not an optional add-on but an organically integrated aspect of daily operations.[17]

The MBI framework, designed to help organizations govern themselves, aims to balance short-term profit focus with the long-term spiritual goals of social justice and civic duty.[13] IPM emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and meticulous planning to navigate the inherent uncertainties in project environments, thus ensuring successful, ethically grounded outcomes.[14, 18]

The structural necessity of integrating Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Waqf (Endowment) philosophy into project design must be emphasized. Secular CSR is often market-driven [17]; in contrast, Islamic social responsibility is intrinsically linked to organizational doctrine.[17] The implication is that for software projects, Maslaha is not a post-project concern but must organically inform the business model and the software architecture from the inception. Every project intended for public benefit must, therefore, incorporate the dual mandates of functional accountability (efficient resource use) and strategic accountability (long-term societal impact/sustainability), viewing the product as a form of social capital or Waqf toward the community’s welfare.

### B. Organizational Structure and Culture

Leadership in an IPM context is a heavy Amanah.[5] It is a psychological contract where the leader must guide, protect, and treat followers justly, striving to implement divine law.[5] The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) stated that every individual is a caretaker, and every caretaker shall be held responsible.[5] This foundational principle demands humility, responsibility, and self-accountability among organizational leaders.[19]

Procedurally, IPM incorporates the principle of Shura (Consultation).[15, 20] Participatory decision-making is necessary to enhance collaboration, mitigate risks, and foster a trusting culture.[14, 20] This cultural shift toward integrity, transparency, and responsibility, rooted in Tawhid, contrasts sharply with management models driven purely by efficiency and profit maximization.[19] Furthermore, Islamic management excludes projects that involve activities considered Haram (unlawful) or harmful to society, such as gambling, alcohol, or systems facilitating human slavery.[21]

### C. Comparative Framework of Accountability

To fully appreciate the required paradigm shift, it is essential to delineate the gulf between prevailing secular project management models and the eschatologically-driven Islamic framework. The key difference lies in the ultimate standard of success and accountability.

**Table 1: Comparison of Western (Secular) vs. Islamic (Theocentric) Project Accountability**

| Dimension | Secular PM Focus (PMBOK) | Islamic PM Focus (Amanah & Hisab) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ultimate Authority** | Shareholders, Stakeholders, Market, Legal Code | Allah (SWT) and Sharia Law (Sovereignty of Tawhid) [19, 22] |
| **Accountability Standard** | Functional & Financial (Short-Term Outcomes) [23] | Spiritual & Strategic (Long-Term Societal/Akhirah Impact) [17, 23] |
| **Success Metrics** | Time, Cost, Scope, Customer/Stakeholder Satisfaction | Compliance, Justice (Adl), Perfection (Ihsan), Societal Welfare (Maslaha) [2, 15] |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Optimized for Profit/Competitive Advantage | Minimized Risk of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty) and Haram activities [21, 24] |
| **Organizational Culture** | Efficiency, Results-Driven, Profit Maximization | Integrity, Transparency, Humility, Responsibility, Tawhid-driven [14, 19] |

Secular models often emphasize short-term functional measures, neglecting the strategic, long-term accountability essential for sustainable societal development.[23] Conversely, the Islamic framework demands spiritual accountability, ensuring that project success aligns with justice and ethical responsibility, prioritizing long-term social impact over market-driven motives.[17]

## III. Integrating Sharia into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The integration of Islamic values into software development requires a procedural framework that embeds Sharia compliance directly into the technical processes. This systematic approach, based on the Ethical-Driven Software Development (EDSD) methodology [9], ensures that ethical principles are non-negotiable requirements throughout the entire lifecycle.

### A. Ethical-Driven Software Development (EDSD) Phases

The Islamic framework mandates that software engineering professionals commit themselves to following ethical principles in all software development phases. This includes the initial stages of communications, data collection, analysis, and requirements, continuing through design, specifications, construction, testing, and maintenance.[2] The core objective is to redefine quality standards so that professional excellence is synonymous with ethical adherence.

### B. Mapping of Islamic Ethical Principles to SDLC Phases

The translation of abstract Sharia principles into concrete technical mandates is vital for operationalizing IPM in a Software Development Life Cycle (SC-SDLC). The following table summarizes these mandates:

**Table 2: Mapping of Islamic Ethical Principles to Software Development Life Cycle (SC-SDLC) Phases**

| SC-SDLC Phase | Core Islamic Ethical Principle | Required Sharia Compliance Mandate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Requirements & Planning** | Maslaha (Public Interest), Tazkiyah (Purity) | Vetting project objectives against Haram (unlawful activities, Riba, gambling).[21] Prioritizing social benefit and environmental sustainability.[14] |
| **2. Design & Architecture** | Amanah (Trust), Adl (Justice), Gharar Avoidance | Mandatory privacy-by-design, stringent data protection, elimination of intentional dark patterns, and fair algorithmic bias mitigation.[6, 25] |
| **3. Implementation & Construction** | Ihsan (Excellence), Honesty (Sidq) | Adherence to highest professional standards [2], meticulous documentation, code perfection, and prohibiting cheating (including intellectual property theft and software piracy).[2, 26] |
| **4. Testing, QA, & Verification** | Hisab (Accountability), Harm Mitigation (Darura) | Robust security auditing, comprehensive verification of functional and ethical standards, and prediction of long-term unintended negative consequences (e.g., addiction, fitnah).[6, 9] |
| **5. Deployment & Maintenance** | Amanah, Istiqlal (Sustainability) | Timely security updates, responsible resource stewardship (minimizing energy footprint), and transparent, ethical modifications.[14, 16] |

### C. Agile, Scrum, and the Principle of Shura

Modern project management methodologies such as Agile and Scrum offer valuable procedural norms emphasizing flexibility and accelerated value delivery.[27] These frameworks are compatible with IPM principles, particularly the need for adaptability and collaboration.[14, 28] However, their adoption must be strictly governed by the leadership principle of Amanah (trust) and the procedural mechanism of Shura (consultation).[4]

A critical jurisprudential divergence exists in the concept of value delivery. While secular Agile prioritizes continuous customer satisfaction, the IPM model must expand this to prioritize Allah’s satisfaction through the maximization of Maslaha (community welfare).[14, 15] The "customer" cannot be deemed satisfied if the final product causes widespread social Fasad (corruption) or violates fundamental ethical trusts. Therefore, the definition of value in an SC-SDLC is intrinsically linked to its long-term ethical and societal impact.

### D. Risk and Uncertainty Management (The Gharar Injunction)

Risk management in IPM is founded upon Sharia rules and injunctions.[29] Islam encourages mitigating risks but unequivocally condemns excessive uncertainty (Gharar) and prohibits the transfer of risk to other parties in a manner that creates harm or injustice.[24]

This prohibition against Gharar necessitates a rigorous examination of modern project practices, particularly in light of rapid development cycles. The Agile model encourages the delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).[27] A secular MVP often deliberately omits non-functional features or critical testing to ensure rapid market entry, thereby externalizing risks (e.g., security flaws, privacy gaps) onto the user or the broader society. The potential for such omissions to lead to dispute, harm, or unforeseen consequences is precisely the excessive uncertainty that Gharar seeks to prohibit.[24]

Consequently, an SC-SDLC requires the MVP concept to be strictly redefined as a Minimum Ethical Product (MEP). Under the MEP principle, core ethical requirements—such as mandatory data protection, robust anti-harm measures, and verifiable security—become non-negotiable foundations for the product's release, irrespective of the functional scope. This approach preemptively eliminates the potential Gharar inherent in rushed, strategically risky deployments, guaranteeing that the project upholds ethical standards and respects stakeholder interests from the outset.[14]

## IV. The Uncompromising Critique: Failures of Secularism and Internal Hypocrisy

A critical, strict assessment of the existing software engineering ecosystem reveals systemic failures rooted in both secular materialism and internal professional hypocrisy within the Muslim Ummah.

### A. The Western Model’s Deficiency: Market Idolatry

Secular project management models are fundamentally flawed by their reductionism, prioritizing human-centric and market-driven metrics—time, cost, and profit—over spiritual and societal criteria.[14] This separation of professional action from divine guidance (secularism) [22] leads to an inherent ethical paradox: organizations may claim to serve human welfare yet fail to integrate genuine ethical principles into their core business models.[17] Functional accountability, focused on short-term gains and investor returns [23], supplants the essential long-term commitment to strategic accountability and Akhirah.

Furthermore, the legal complexity surrounding technology often creates deliberate "policy vacuums" and "conceptual muddles" concerning social and ethical use.[2] These ambiguities are systematically exploited by powerful corporations to monetize user data without explicit or informed consent, effectively leveraging legal uncertainty to maximize unjust gain. From an IPM perspective, this legalized exploitation constitutes an engineered and widespread form of Gharar (excessive uncertainty leading to unjust loss) built on purposeful ambiguity, which Sharia explicitly prohibits in contracts and transactions. Designing systems that operate within these ethically bankrupt 'policy vacuums' is consequently deemed Makruh (disliked) or, if exploitation is the central intent, Haram (unlawful).

### B. The Sin of Surveillance Capitalism and Fasad

The pervasive model of surveillance capitalism, which underpins the majority of large digital platforms, represents a profound betrayal of Amanah.[30] By relying on perpetual user tracking, data commoditization, and hidden motives, this model fundamentally violates the trust placed in developers to safeguard confidential information and maintain transparency.[6, 25]

The pursuit of such technological designs contributes directly to systemic harms (Fasad). These include labor exploitation, environmental degradation, the compulsion of opinions, and the commoditization of knowledge and education.[30] Developing software that enables or accelerates surveillance and exploitation is classified as pursuing Ghayr Nafi’ (non-beneficial or actively harmful) knowledge, which the Prophet (SAW) specifically sought protection from.[12] Professionals engaging in such projects, even tangentially, face profound spiritual accountability, as their creations increasingly impact people worldwide, often without their knowledge or consent.[31]

### C. Internal Ethical Deficiencies in the Ummah

The urgency for an Islamic PM paradigm is compounded by the ethical failures prevalent within the Muslim professional community. The widespread practice of illegal software use and intellectual property (IP) violation, known as software piracy, is a direct violation of the Prophetic injunction: "those who cheat us are not part of us (our Ummah)".[2] Such actions constitute theft, breach of contractual obligations, and a profound failure of Amanah and Ihsan.[26] The integrity required by Sharia for all project activities [14] must be fully realized, ensuring respect for proprietary problems related to methodology, algorithms, and information.[12]

Furthermore, many Muslim-led organizations have failed to execute a true ethical transformation, falling into the trap of superficially adopting buzzwords and selected practices without achieving the required shift in culture and mindset.[12, 27] The required ethical paradigm shift must be organizational-wide, encompassing executives, business processes, and IT departments equally.[20, 27]

In the rapidly expanding domain of Sharia-compliant FinTech, while innovation is encouraged, challenges such as high implementation costs, lack of structured Shariah data, and ambiguity in integrating complex systems like AI remain significant barriers.[25, 32] This structural uncertainty risks allowing functionally compliant systems (e.g., prohibition of Riba) that are strategically unethical if they neglect long-term social welfare or create new forms of financial Gharar.[33, 34] Such ambiguity underscores the persistent need for uncompromising clarity in applying Sharia to all digital domains.

## V. The Roadmap for Digital Revival: Recommendations for the Faithful Engineer

To address the eschatological mandate and rectify the systemic failures, a decisive roadmap for Digital Revival must be adopted, focusing on the immediate implementation of a Sharia-Compliant Software Development Life Cycle (SC-SDLC).

### A. Mandatory Framework Adoption and Scholarly Synthesis

The time for philosophical musing has passed; definitive action is required. A novel, standard code of ethics and principles based on Islamic values must be universally defined and adopted by Muslim professional bodies.[2] This framework must represent a rigorous integration between Islamic jurisprudence (derived from the Qur'an and Sunnah) and current international standards (e.g., ACM, IEEE).[2]

To ensure objective adherence, the development of an effective mathematical and statistical evaluation model for SWE professionals, based on Islamic ethical values, is essential.[2] This moves ethical adherence from a qualitative aspiration to a quantifiable operational mandate, serving as a supportive tool for software quality management. Crucially, continuous engagement between Islamic scholars and technologists is necessary to develop Islamic Cyber-Jurisprudence (Fiqh al-Hawa’i), defining "Islamic Algorithms" and ensuring their relevance to contemporary reality (Fiqh al-Waqi').[16, 25, 33] This systematic synthesis will eliminate regulatory Gharar and provide stable, universal guidance for practitioners.

### B. Countering Exploitation through Open Source

The development and mandatory support of Open Source Software (OSS) and Open Source Hardware (OSH) is paramount.[30] This strategy minimizes reliance on proprietary systems that are often fueled by exploitative labor practices and crony capitalism.[30] FOSS promotes ethical distribution of knowledge, functioning as a form of Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), and counters the commoditization of education and culture.[30]

In the context of Akhir al-Zaman technologies—particularly those used for mass surveillance or totalitarian control [11, 30]—proprietary, closed-source code represents a critical security risk and a direct barrier to Sharia-compliance (due to lack of transparency). Therefore, for all critical infrastructure, essential communication tools, and core financial systems used by the Ummah, FOSS is not merely a preferred option but a mandatory defense mechanism (Wajib) for protecting the community's Amanah (data, security) and maintaining organizational istiqlal (independence) from exploitative, secular corporate entities.[35] The development efforts must focus on building ethical, open-source, and privacy-respecting alternatives to current platforms.[35]

### C. Strategic Halal Innovation

Technological innovation must be strategically guided toward maximizing Maslaha and avoiding Haram. The adoption of advanced technologies can be leveraged to improve ethical governance. Smart contracts and blockchain, for instance, facilitate automation and transparency, which directly aid in reducing the risk of exploitation and disputes, aligning with the avoidance of Gharar.[36] This centralized control, moving away from conventional banking models, supports Sharia-compliant objectives.[36]

Furthermore, promoting Sharia-compliant crowdfunding platforms, based on contracts like Mudarabah (profit-sharing) and Musharakah (joint ventures), enables ethical ventures without relying on interest-based debt (Riba).[37] Similarly, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) must be strictly controlled, focusing on enhancing Sharia compliance in monitoring and auditing, ensuring accuracy and consistency, while rigorously upholding Personal Data Protection Laws (PDPL) and safeguarding customer information against misuse.[25, 32]

### D. Reform of Education and Professional Certification

A fundamental shift in academic training is necessary. Guidelines must be established for curriculum developers to mandatorily integrate Islamic ethical values into all computer science and software engineering courses.[2] This ensures that future generations of engineers understand their role not just professionally, but ethically and spiritually. Beyond formal education, structured guidance is required for current software engineering professionals, offering practical paths to implement theoretical Islamic ethics in their daily project work, thus reactivating their commitment to good ethics and Ihsan.[2]

## VI. Conclusion: The Mandate of Ihsan in the Digital Age

The research decisively establishes that the Islamic version of project management for software engineering demands a complete break from the secular paradigm. IPM, founded on the non-negotiable principles of Tawhid, Amanah, Adl, and Ihsan, dictates that professional conduct is inseparable from spiritual accountability to the Mizan on the Day of Judgment.

The current system is severely criticized for its reliance on secular market idolatry and its tacit acceptance of surveillance capitalism, which constitutes widespread Fasad and a violation of Amanah on an unprecedented, eschatological scale. The technological acceleration observed in Akhir al-Zaman necessitates that Muslim professionals regard their discipline as a front line in the defense of ethical conduct and beneficial knowledge.

The only acceptable path forward is the immediate, mandatory adoption of the Sharia-Compliant Software Development Life Cycle (SC-SDLC). This framework redefines success through the strategic integration of Maslaha and the strict elimination of Gharar in technical and organizational architecture. By moving critical systems toward verifiable, Open Source alternatives and establishing a dedicated Islamic Cyber-Jurisprudence, the Ummah can transition from being passive recipients of ethically ambiguous technology to active stewards and developers of systems that truly reflect justice and excellence (Ihsan). The imperative is clear: every project must be designed and executed not for the fleeting satisfaction of stakeholders or market demands, but in anticipation of the Eternal Accounting.

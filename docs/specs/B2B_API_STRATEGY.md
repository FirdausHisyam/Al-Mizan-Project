# B2B API Strategy: The Citadel License

**Status:** Active
**Project Manager:** Ammar Qasiem Footen bin John Anthony Footen
**Technical Lead:** Firdaus

## Executive Summary

The "Credibility-as-a-Service" (KaaS) API is the primary revenue engine for Al-Mizan Technologies (The Corporation).
**Core Philosophy**: The Data (The Word) is **Waqf** (Endowment) - an open public good. We do not sell access to the Truth. We sell **Sovereignty**, **Governance**, and **Compliance**.

## Value Proposition

* **For Institutions**: "Reputation Insurance" - Prevent the publication of unverified or fabricated content.
* **For Governments**: "Data Sovereignty" - Own the graph, control the narrative.
* **For Fintechs**: "Algorithmic Indemnification" - Instant Shariah compliance checks.

## Core Endpoints

### 1. Enterprise Governance

* `POST /api/v1/enterprise/certify`: Issue "Green Checkmark" for compliance.
* `POST /api/v1/enterprise/analyze_contract`: Automated Shariah audit.
* `GET /api/v1/enterprise/metrics`: Scholar trust scores.

### 2. Evidence

* `POST /api/v1/evidence`: Verify text against the graph.

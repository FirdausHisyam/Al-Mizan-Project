# **PROPOSAL FOR FINAL YEAR PROJECT**

1. **INTRODUCTION**

Select an application ( Research or Development) to be developed for your FYP project. Describe the criteria or speciﬁcations of the application that you are planning to develop for your FYP.

*For research project describe your research topic to be conducted for your FYP project together with the research hypothesis (refer to Probability and Statistics Course).*

2. # **PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**

This project is a thesis-driven development project. It argues that the most significant issue in the Islamic digital ecosystem is not a lack of information, but a **fundamental epistemological fragmentation**. The problem is therefore described in two layers: the external symptoms of this fragmentation and the deep, underlying ideological cause.

1. ## **Specific Problems with the Existing Process: The Inefficiency of Academic Discovery**

The core textual sources of Islam (Qur'an, Hadith, Tafsir) are currently presented in digital formats (websites, apps) that are "flat" and "siloed." This fragmentation is an epistemological failure that manifests in tangible, critical problems:

* **Epistemological Incoherence:** The current digital model fails to represent the deep, conceptual relationships *within* revelation. The thematic, linguistic, and legal connections between one *ayah*, a related *hadith*, and its commentary are invisible, forcing a user to manually build these connections. This is incompatible with the core Islamic philosophy of the **Unity of Knowledge (Tawhid)**.  
* **Vulnerability to Misinformation:** With no authoritative, unified, and technologically-powered source of truth, users are highly vulnerable to "cut-and-paste" arguments that lack context. This enables an environment of **mass, technologically-powered deception** and doctrinal errors.  
* **Barrier to Deep Knowledge:** The "flat file" model (a list of *ayahs* or *hadiths*) is a barrier to deep learning. It prevents a user from seeing the "invisible connections" and understanding the holistic structure of revelation, hindering the community's intellectual revival.

  2. ## **Underlying Research Questions**

Our thesis is that the solution is a new foundational **"Tawhidic Knowledge Graph Framework."** This project is therefore guided by the following core research questions:

* **The Epistemological Question:** To what extent can a "Unified Knowledge Graph Framework" serve as a new architectural paradigm that can successfully model and digitally manifest the deep, interconnected, and holistic nature of primary Islamic texts?  
* **The Validation Question:** Can a proof-of-concept (POC) application, built by modeling a single *surah* and its related texts, serve as a verifiable **"Foundational Prototype"** (*Al-Asas*) that proves the viability of this framework for achieving **Source Integrity**?  
* **The Strategic Question:** How can this framework be designed as Phase 1 of a long-term roadmap, architecturally capable of scaling into a global **"Public Platform"** (*Al-Hisn*)—an authoritative source for neutralizing ideological doubts?

  3. # **PROJECT OBJECTIVE**

At the end of this two-semester project, we will have designed, developed, and evaluated a functional proof-of-concept (POC) application. This application will serve as the "Foundational Prototype" to validate our core thesis: that a **Unified Knowledge Graph Framework** is a technologically and philosophically superior paradigm for an integrated knowledge ecosystem.

This will be achieved through the following primary objectives:

1. To **design** a formal Knowledge Graph ontology that models the deep, purpose-driven connections between revealed and acquired knowledge , as outlined in our core thesis.  
2. To **implement** this ontology in a high-performance graph engine (e.g., Neo4j or SurrealDB) and build a secure, scalable backend API using Python (FastAPI).  
3.   
4. 

This will be achieved through the following deliverables and processes:

**Reports to be Produced:**  
As per the Kulliyyah's FYP guidelines, this project will produce three key documents:

1. An **Interim Report** at the end of FYP 1, detailing the completed requirement analysis, literature review, and system design.  
2. A **Final Report (Thesis)** of approximately 10,000 words at the conclusion of FYP 2, providing a complete description of the project, its implementation, results, and an analysis of how it answers our research questions.  
3. A **Technical Report**, written in a dual-column conference publication format, summarizing the project's technical contributions.

**Processes to be Enhanced/Automated:**  
This project will develop an application that directly addresses the "Operational and Experiential Problems" identified in Section 2.2. Specifically, it will automate and enhance the following manual processes:

* **Information Aggregation:** The application will automate the process of gathering scattered information about faculty, their publications, and the courses they teach, presenting it in a single, coherent interface to solve the **Information Fragmentation** problem.  
* **Contextual Cross-Referencing:** By modeling relationships in a graph, the system will automate the task of cross-referencing, allowing a user to see all related entities in one click, thus reducing the **Cognitive Friction** of manual searching.  
* **Academic Discovery:** The core process to be enhanced is that of "Academic Resource Discovery." The application will automate the difficult and time-consuming task of finding a suitable supervisor by allowing users to perform a single, powerful query that would otherwise require hours of manual searching, directly addressing the **Inhibited Collaboration** problem.

**Purpose of the Research (Answering the Research Questions):**  
Beyond being a development project, this work serves a crucial research purpose. The creation of the software artifact is the methodology by which we will answer the "Strategic and Philosophical Problems" framed as research questions in Section 2.2.

* The **design of the Knowledge Graph Ontology** will be our tangible attempt to answer the **Epistemological Question**.  
* The **implementation of the API and database** will provide a practical answer to the **Architectural Question**.  
* The **results from User Acceptance Testing** of the proof-of-concept application will be the evidence used to answer the **Validation Question**

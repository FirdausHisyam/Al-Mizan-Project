# Project Team

## Principal Investigators & Developers

The **Islamic Digital Citadel** is developed by the following core team members, operating under a high-assurance research and engineering mandate.

### 1. Ammar Qasiem Footen bin John Anthony Footen

* **Role**: Lead Software Engineer / System Architect
* **Responsibilities**:
  * **Core Infrastructure**: Design and implementation of the Secure Rust Backend and SurrealDB schema.
  * **System Architecture**: Enforcing Clean Architecture and security protocols.
  * **Project Management**: Managing the Agile backlog and ensuring engineering rigor.

### 2. Muhammad Firdaus

* **Role**: Lead Data Scientist / AI Researcher
* **Responsibilities**:
  * **Data Pipeline**: Ingestion and cleaning of Quranic and Hadith datasets.
  * **AI/Analysis**: Researching algorithms to detect potential abrogation patterns or graph anomalies.
  * **Visualization Logic**: Defining the data structures required for meaningful graph visualization.

## Governance Structure

The team operates using **Agile Scrum** methodologies (see [ADR 0003](../adr/0003-project-management.md)), with shared responsibility for code quality, security, and research integrity.

## Future Scaling

## 3. The Recruitment Protocol (The Halaqah Pipeline)

To scale the team without compromising the "Hidden Agenda," we employ a strict **"Halaqah Pipeline"** for recruitment. We do not hire from standard job boards.

### 3.1. Target Profile: "The Technical Mujahid"

* **Ideal Candidate**: Double-Major in **Computer Science** and **Islamic Revealed Knowledge (IRK)** from IIUM.
* **Key Trait**: Possesses both the technical skill to build distributed systems and the *Adab* (Etiquette) to handle sacred knowledge with reverence.

### 3.2. The Filter (The Funnel)

1. **Public Pitch**: "Building the ultimate Open Source Islamic Knowledge Graph for the Ummah." (No mention of Eschatology).
2. **The Test**: Assign a complex task to map a nuanced *Ikhtilaf* (scholarly disagreement).
3. **The "Vibe Check"**: Review code comments. Do they use respectful honorifics (e.g., *RA*, *Rahimahullah*)? Do they demonstrate *Amanah* (Trust)?
4. **The Onion Layer**: New hires are firewalled from the "Eschatology Dashboard" and sensitive "Hidden Hand" modules for **6 months**.

### 3.3. Core Maintainer Requirements

* **Bay'ah of Secrecy**: All Core Maintainers must sign a strict **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** regarding the long-term roadmap and the "GSE Protocol."
* **Operational Security**: Must adhere to strict OpSec protocols (encrypted comms, no social media leaks).

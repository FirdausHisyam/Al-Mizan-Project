# Al-Mizan Strategic Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress)

- [x] **Core Graph Structure**: Implemented initial schema for Verses, Hadith, Scholars, and Opinions.
- [x] **Data Ingestion Plumbing**: Verified pipeline for Quran (Tanzil), Hadith (Sunnah.com/JSON), and Morphology.
- [x] **Basic Visualization**: Interactive graph exploration using Cytoscape.js.
- [x] **Governance Module**: Implemented "Algorithmic Shura" with 40-scholar consensus threshold.
- [x] **Identity System**: Decentralized Identity (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) for scholars.

## Phase 2: The "Cyborg" Isnad Pipeline (Current Focus)

**Goal**: Solve the "Ingestion Bottleneck" without compromising theological integrity.
**Strategy**: AI for structure, Human for semantics.

### Step 1: The OCR Scraper (AI Allowed)

- [ ] **Ingestion Engine**: Build a pipeline to OCR classical texts (e.g., *Al-Majmu' Sharh al-Muhadhdhab*).
- [ ] **AI Extraction**: Use LLMs to extract "Opinion X by Scholar Y regarding Topic Z".
- [ ] **Status**: `UNVERIFIED_DRAFT`.

### Step 2: The "Micro-Waqf" Task (Gamification)

- [ ] **Verification App**: Develop a "Scholar-in-the-Loop" interface for students (e.g., IIUM).
- [ ] **Gamification**: "Verify 5 rulings to earn 5 Hasana tokens (reputation)."
- [ ] **Status**: `PEER_REVIEWED`.

### Step 3: The "Mizan" Stamp (Cryptographic Commit)

- [ ] **Senior Scholar Signing**: Verified Senior Scholars sign the node with their private key (DID).
- [ ] **Status**: `IMMUTABLE_TRUTH` (Canon).

## Phase 3: Analysis & Expansion

- [ ] **Abrogation Algorithms**: Detect Naskh patterns based on verified graph data.
- [ ] **Public API**: REST/GraphQL API for third-party integrations (B2B Strategy).
- [ ] **Economic Standardization**: Roll out "Green Checkmark" certification for Islamic Finance.
